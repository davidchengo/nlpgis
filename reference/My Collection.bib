The paper improves the previous proposed Semantic Question Answering System which applies Link Grammar and WordNet to form a Semantic Tree to represent the meaning of question and further find the relevant answer based on the selected Data Structure Ontology. The paper addresses the improved functions including the flexible answering method which can refine the Semantic Tree to find more relevant answers, the Ontology Extension Module is designed to acquire data from Internet to raise the ontology and the Feedback for System module is designed for the instructors to provide more sufficient knowledge.},

This paradigm is placed in central position of many investigations in the field of human machine interaction in these years. Precisited natural language addresses a model for dealing with vagueness of information and suggests a kind of knowledge representation, deduction and computational approach for natural language manipulation. Moreover, ontological architecture is an accepted model for developing this theory. In this work we are going to develop an ontology based question answering system which is one of crucial application of this paradigm.},

This system allows users to retrieve information from formal ontologies by using as input queries formulated in natural language. The original characteristic of QACID is the strategy used to fill the gap between users expressiveness and formal knowledge representation. This approach is based on collections of user queries and offers a simple adaptability to deal with multilingual capabilities, inter-domain portability and changes in user information requirements. All these capabilities permit developing Question Answering applications for actual users. This system has been developed and tested on the Spanish language and using an ontology modelling the cinema domain. The performance level achieved enables the use of the system in real environments.},

In this method, a set of question patterns, called hypothesis questions, was automatically produced from a domain ontology, along with their corresponding SPARQL query templates for answer retrieval. Then the QA task was reduced to the problem of looking for the hypothesis question that was entailed by a user question and taking its corresponding query template to produce a complete query for retrieving the answers from underlying knowledge bases. An entailment engine was used to discover the entailed hypothesis questions with the help of question classification. An evaluation was carried out to assess the accuracy of the QA method, and the results revealed that most of the user questions (65\%) can be correctly answered with a semantic entailment engine enhanced by the domain ontology.},

The approach is domain and language-independent and can be considered a general framework for both open domain question answering and natural language interfaces to databases. We provide definitions for an interactive question answer (IQA) ontology which capture significant aspects of interaction, and suggest how dialogue templates based on the IQA ontology can model natural and rich dialogues with a user.},

The important modules in the question answering system are introduced in the paper. The domain ontology is base stone of the system. The improved Bayesian method based on ontology is adopted to classify the questions. The questions are located by index and search technology in FAQ firstly; it can rapidly locate the question and return answer. For question outside of FAQ, semantic meaning of questions need to be analyze, the question semantic representation method is adopted in the process. Two strategies are adopted to extract answer knowledge, and return the answer in natural language. Experimental results show that the system is effective in answering the question in music knowledge domain.},

abstract = {Large scale texts as the knowledge base of extracting answer can ensure the accuracy of information resources and also make information convenient for management. This paper presents the development of question answer system of restricted domain based on knowledge base and proposes an answer extraction method based on the sentence similarity and organization names, and which implements the study of question answering system of restricted domain based on knowledge base. The experiments prove that the introduction of organization names not only greatly improves the segmentation accuracy in the module of words segmentation but also improves the retrieval efficiency of system and the accuracy of answer extraction.},

abstract = {This chapter investigates a statistical approach to open domain question answering. Although the work presented in this chapter centers around maximum entropy models, the models required can be modelled using any machine learning approach. To perform question answering, as has been discussed in previous chapters, questions are first analyzed and a prediction is made as to what type of answer the user is expecting. Secondly, a fast search of the text database is performed and the top documents relevant to the query are retrieved. These documents have been annotated automatically using a named entity tagger. Finally, the answer tag prediction and the annotated documents are input to the answer selection stage. Results obtained from a trainable answer selection algorithm are reported.},

@article{Juarez-Gonzalez2007,
abstract = {This paper describes a QA system centered in a full data-driven architecture. It applies machine learning and text mining techniques to identify the most probable answers to factoid and definition questions respectively. Its major quality is that it mainly relies on the use of lexical information and avoids applying any complex language processing resources such as named entity classifiers, parsers and ontologies. Experimental results on the Spanish Question Answering task at CLEF 2006 show that the proposed architecture can be a practical solution for monolingual question answering by reaching a precision as high as 51\%.},

abstract = {Both healthcare professionals and healthcare consumers have information needs that can be met through the use of computers, specifically via medical question answering systems. However, the information needs of both groups are different in terms of literacy levels and technical expertise, and an effective question answering system must be able to account for these differences if it is to formulate the most relevant responses for users from each group. In this paper, we propose that a first step toward answering the queries of different users is automatically classifying questions according to whether they were asked by healthcare professionals or consumers.},
