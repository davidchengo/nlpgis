Abstract: Question Answering systems are one of the hot topics in context of information retrieval. In this paper, we develop an open-domain Question Answering system for spatial queries. We use Google for gathering raw data from the Web and then in a few iterations density of potential answers will be increased, finally based on a couple of evaluators the best answers are selected to be returned to user. Our proposed algorithm uses fuzzy methods to be more precise. Some experiments have been designed in order to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and results are totally promising. We will describe that how this algorithm can be applied to other type of questions as well.

Abstract: This paper describes GeoTALP-IR system, a Geographical Information Retrieval (GIR) system. The system is described and evaluated in the context of our participation in the CLEF 2005 GeoCLEF Monolingual English task.
The GIR system is based on Lucene and uses a modified version of the Passage Retrieval module of the TALP Question Answering (QA) system presented at CLEF 2004 and TREC 2004 QA evaluation tasks. We designed a Keyword Selection algorithm based on a Linguistic and Geographical Analysis of the topics. A Geographical Thesaurus (GT) has been built using a set of publicly available Geographical Gazetteers and a Geographical Ontology. Our experiments show that the use of a Geographical Thesaurus for Geographical Indexing and Retrieval has improved the performance of our GIR system.

Abstract: This paper describes our experiments in Geographical Information Retrieval (GIR) in the context of our participation in the CLEF 2006 GeoCLEF Monolingual English task. Our system, named TALP-GeoIR, follows a similar architecture of the GeoTALP-IR system presented at GeoCLEF 2005 with some changes in the retrieval modes and the Geographical Knowledge Base (KB).
The system has four phases performed sequentially: i) a Keyword Selection algorithm based on a linguistic and geographical analysis of the topics: ii) a geographical retrieval with Lucene, iii) a document retrieval task with the JIRS Passage Retrieval (PR) software, and iv) a Document Ranking phase. A Geographical KB has been built using a set of publicly available geographical gazetteers and the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) Feature Type Thesaurus.
In our experiments we have used JIRS, a state-of-the-art PR system for Question Answering, for the GIR task. We also have experimented with an approach using both JIRS and Lucene. In this approach JIRS was used only for textual document retrieval and Lucene was used to detect the geographically relevant documents. These experiments show that applying only JIRS we obtain better results than combining JIRS and Lucene.

Abstract: This paper describes the GIRSA-WP system and the experiments performed for GikiCLEF 2009, the geographic information retrieval task in the question answering track at CLEF 2009. Three runs were submitted. The first one contained only results from the InSicht QA system; it showed high precision, but low recall. The combination with results from the GIR system GIRSA increased recall considerably, but reduced precision. The second run used a standard IR query, while the third run combined such queries with a Boolean query with selected keywords. The evaluation showed that the third run achieved significantly higher mean average precision (MAP) than the second run. In both cases, integrating GIR methods and QA methods was successful in combining their strengths (high precision of deep QA, high recall of GIR), resulting in the third-best performance of automatic runs in GikiCLEF. The overall performance still leaves room for improvements. For example, the multilingual approach is too simple. All processing is done in only one Wikipedia (the German one); results for the nine other languages are collected by following the translation links in Wikipedia.

Abstract: One of issues in the bootstrapping for named entity recognition is how to control annotation errors introduced at every iteration. In this paper, we present several heuristics for reducing such errors using external resources such as WordNet, encyclopedia and Web documents. The bootstrapping is applied for identifying and classifying fine-grained geographic named entities, which are useful for applications such as information extraction and question answering, as well as standard named entities such as PERSON and ORGANIZATION. The experiments show the usefulness of the suggested heuristics and the learning curve evaluated at each bootstrapping loop. When our approach was applied to a newspaper corpus, it could achieve 87 F1 value, which is quite promising for the fine-grained named entity recognition task.

Abstract: Geographic named entities can be classified into many sub-types that are useful for applications such as information extraction and question answering. In this paper, we present a bootstrapping algorithm for the task of geographic named entity annotation. In the initial stage, we annotate a raw corpus using seeds. From the initial annotation, boundary patterns are learned and applied to the corpus again to annotate new candidates. Type verification is adopted to reduce over-generation. One sense per discourse principle increases positive instances and also corrects mistaken annotations. As the bootstrapping loop proceeds, the annotated instances are increased gradually and the learned boundary patterns become gradually richer.

Abstract: Geographic named entities can be classified into many sub-types that are useful for applications such as information extraction and question answering. In this paper, we present a high-performance bootstrapping algorithm with error correction heuristics and location normalization for the task of geographic named entity annotation with seven sub-types. Location normalization additionally resolves ambiguities of entities with same name and sub-types. In the initial stage, we annotate a raw corpus using a large set of seeds which is automatically selected from a gazetteer so that its quality does not depend on a specific training corpus. From the initial annotation, boundary patterns reflecting phrasal context are learned and applied to the corpus again to obtain new annotation which passes through error correction heuristics. As the bootstrapping loop proceeds, the annotated instances are gradually increased and the learned boundary patterns become gradually richer and more accurate. Through experiments, we explore inter/intra-phrasal context which reflects syntactic constraints of a named entity and several heuristic knowledge for correcting annotation errors introduced by incomplete boundary patterns. The experiments show the effect of the strategies on the learning curve. When our bootstrapping approach was applied to a newspaper corpus, it could achieve 89 F1 value. And the method suggested for location normalization could achieve 95% accuracy at instance level. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: For the participation of GIRSA at the GeoCLEF 2007 task, two innovative features were introduced to the geographic information retrieval (GIR) system: identification and normalization of location indicators, i.e. text segments from which a geographic scope can be inferred, and the application of techniques from question answering. In an extension of a previously performed experiment, the latter approach was combined with an approach using semantic networks for geographic retrieval. When using the topic title and description, the best performance was achieved by the combination of approaches (0.196 mean average precision, MAP); adding location names from the narrative part increased MAP to 0.258. Results indicate that 1) employing normalized location indicators improves MAP significantly and increases the number of relevant documents found; 2) additional location names from the narrative increase MAP and recall, and 3) the semantic network approach has a high initial precision and even adds some relevant documents which were previously not found. For the bilingual experiments, English queries were translated into German by the Promt machine translation web service. Performance for these experiments is generally lower. The baseline experiment (0.114 MAP) is clearly outperformed, achieving the best performance for a setup using title, description, and narrative (0.209 MAP).

Abstract: This paper describes the participation of GIRSA at Geo-CLEF 2008, the geographic information retrieval task at CLEF. GIRSA combines information retrieval (IR) on geographically annotated data and question answering (QA) employing query decomposition.
For the monolingual German experiments, several parameter settings were varied: using a single index or separate indexes for content and geographic annotation, using complex term weighting, adding location names from the topic narrative, and merging results from IR and QA, which yields the highest mean average precision (0.2608 MAP). For bilingual experiments, English and Portuguese topics were translated via the web services Applied Language Solutions, Google Translate, and Promt Online Translator.
For both source languages, Google Translate seems to return the best translations. For English (Portuguese) topics, 60.2% (80.0%) of the maximum MAP for monolingual German experiments, or 0.1571 MAP (0.2085 MAP), is achieved.
As a post-official experiment, translations of English topics were analysed with a parser. The results were employed to select the best translation for topic titles and descriptions. The corresponding retrieval experiment; achieved 69.7% of the MAP of the best monolingual experiment.

Abstract: This paper describes the participation of GIRSA at Geo-CLEF 2008, the geographic information retrieval task at CLEF. GIRSA combines information retrieval (IR) on geographically annotated data and question answering (QA) employing query decomposition.
For the monolingual German experiments, several parameter settings were varied: using a single index or separate indexes for content and geographic annotation, using complex term weighting, adding location names from the topic narrative, and merging results from IR and QA, which yields the highest mean average precision (0.2608 MAP). For bilingual experiments, English and Portuguese topics were translated via the web services Applied Language Solutions, Google Translate, and Promt Online Translator.
For both source languages, Google Translate seems to return the best translations. For English (Portuguese) topics, 60.2% (80.0%) of the maximum MAP for monolingual German experiments, or 0.1571 MAP (0.2085 MAP), is achieved.

Abstract: This paper describes our work for the participation at the GeoCLEF task of CLEF 2005. We employ multilayered extended semantic networks for the representation of background knowledge, queries, and documents for geographic information retrieval (GIR). In our approach, geographic concepts from the query network are expanded with concepts which are semantically connected via topological, directional, and proximity relations. We started with an existing geographic knowledge base represented as a semantic network and expanded it with concepts automatically extracted from the GEOnet Names Server.
Several experiments for GIR on German documents have been performed: a baseline corresponding to a traditional information retrieval approach; a variant expanding thematic, temporal, and geographic descriptors from the semantic network representation of the query; and an adaptation of a question answering (QA) algorithm based on semantic networks. The second experiment is based on a representation of the natural language description of a topic as a semantic network, which is achieved by a deep linguistic analysis. The semantic network is transformed into an intermediate representation of a database query explicitly representing thematic, temporal, and local restrictions. This experiment showed the best performance with respect to mean average precision: 10.53% using the topic title and description. The third experiment, adapting a QA algorithm, uses a modified version of the QA system InSicht. The system matches deep semantic representations of queries or their equivalent or similar variants to semantic networks for document sentences.

Abstract: Automatic Text Summarization has been shown to be useful for Natural Language Processing tasks such as Question Answering or Text Classification and other related fields of computer science such as Information Retrieval. Since Geographical Information Retrieval can be considered as an extension of the Information Retrieval field, the generation of summaries could be integrated into these systems by acting as an intermediate stage, with the purpose of reducing the document length. In this manner, the access time for information searching will be improved, while at the same time relevant documents will be also retrieved. Therefore, in this paper we propose the generation of two types of summaries (generic and geographical) applying several compression rates in order to evaluate their effectiveness in the Geographical Information Retrieval task. The evaluation has been carried out using GeoCLEF as evaluation framework and following an Information Retrieval perspective without considering the geo-reranking phase commonly used in these systems. Although single-document summarization has not performed well in general, the slight improvements obtained for some types of the proposed summaries, particularly for those based on geographical information, made us believe that the integration of Text Summarization with Geographical Information Retrieval may be beneficial, and consequently, the experimental set-up developed in this research work serves as a basis for further investigations in this field.

Abstract: Gazetteer services are an important component in a wide variety of systems, including geographic search engines and question answering systems. Unfortunately, the footprints provided by gazetteers are often limited to a bounding box or even a centroid. Moreover, for a lot of non-political regions, detailed footprints are nonexistent since these regions tend to have gradual, rather than crisp, boundaries. In this paper we propose an automatic method to approximate the footprints of crisp, as well as imprecise, regions using statements on the web as a starting point. Due to the vague nature of some of these statements, the resulting footprints are represented as fuzzy sets.

Abstract: The availability of an increasing number and variety of information sources via the Internet raises questions about their potential value for "ready reference," responding to questions that require basic factual answers. Libraries can supplement their existing reference collections (printed books, microforms, CD-ROMs, and licensed online databases) with access to resources available for free via the Internet. This paper provides a framework for assessing how these new resources can best be used for ready reference and how they compare with materials already purchased or leased by libraries. In particular, Internet equivalents of dictionaries, encyclopedias, directories, almanacs and handbooks, geographical sources, and biographical sources are considered. Concerns regarding Internet-based resources include the frequent difficulty in assessing their scope, currency, and authority as well as their potential instability. Nevertheless, there are a number of instances where these resources are quite valuable in responding to ready reference questions. The paper concludes with a call for more research to determine the efficacy of question answering with and without use of Internet resources, as well as to determine the added value that reference librarians can bring to question answering now that library users have more options for searching by themselves or turning to Web-based question-answering services.
